ButtonSet component

This renders a set of buttons and associates onClick handlers.

Props:
- buttons - an array of objects with "text", "kind", and "onClick" properties
  * text is a string
  * kind is one of "default", "primary", "info", "success", "secondary", or "danger"
    - these correspond to colors defined in app.scss
  * onClick is a function

Notes:
  The className prop on the div element that contains all the buttons should be "button-set".
