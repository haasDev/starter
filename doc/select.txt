This renders a dropdown using the HTML select and option elements.

Props:

- onChange - a function called when the user selects a new value
- options - an array of objects with "key" and "value" properties (both are strings)
- length - optional number used to get a scrollable list of values

Notes:
  The className prop on the select element should be "select".
